  - selection bias

**Selection bias** occurs when the sample used for analysis is **not representative** of the population, leading to inaccurate insights and biased conclusions.

### Dealing with selection bias in [[Insurance|insurance]]

- Group policies
- Testing and referrals
- Mandatory government insurance

### Example: Health Insurance

Healthy people won't sign up because they don't want to pay, only people with health conditions sign up, so the whole thing collapses and doesn't work. 

The government can make it mandatory that insurance companies do not look at the selection. Obamacare is known for that, that health insurance companies are not allowed to take pre-existing conditions into account.

### U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010 (Obamacare)

- Penalty for individuals not buying insurance
- Penalty for companies not buying insurance for their employees
- New insurance exchanges A health insurance exchange is a set of state regulated and standardized health care plans, from which individuals may purchase health insurance that is eligible for Federal subsidies
- Insurance companies may not disallow for preexisting conditions, or drop people who get sick.
