  - selection bias

**Selection bias** occurs when the sample used for analysis is **not representative** of the population, leading to inaccurate insights and biased conclusions.

### Dealing with selection bias in [[Insurance|insurance]]

- Group policies
- Testing and referrals
- Mandatory government insurance

### Example: Health Insurance

Health insurance tends to attract sick people. So health insurance companies ask for a medical exam, traditionally, to screen out people who know they're already going to be sick. 

If they're not successful in doing that, then the selection bias can harm their business and it can destroy an insurance business.

Healthy people won't sign up because they don't want to pay, only sick people sign up, so the whole thing collapses and doesn't work. 

The government can make it mandatory that insurance companies do not look at the selection. Obamacare is known for that, that health insurance companies are not allowed to take pre-existing conditions into account.
