Beta ($\beta$) is a measure of the volatility, or [[Systematic Risk|systematic risk] of a security or [[portfolio]] compared to the market as a whole (usually the S&P 500). Stocks with betas higher than 1.0 can be interpreted as more volatile than the S&P 500.

Beta ($\beta$) represents the sensitivity of an [[asset]]’s [[Return|returns]] to market movements.
- A **positive beta** implies that the [[asset]] tends to move in the **same direction** as the market.
- A **negative beta** suggests that the [[asset]] moves **opposite** to the market.
- A **higher beta** implies **greater [[Risk]]** but it also suggests the potential for **higher expected [[Return|returns]]**.

Mathematically, beta ($\beta$) is equal to the [[Covariance|covariance]] divided by the [[Variance|variance]] of the market [[Return|returns]].
$$\beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\text{Var}(R_m)}$$
- $R_i$ = [[Return]] of the [[asset]]
- $R_m$ = [[Return]] of the market
