The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that calculates the expected rate of [[return]] for an [[asset]] or investment. It establishes a linear relationship between the required [[return]] on an investment and its [[Risk]].

The CAPM implies that the expected [[return]] on the i-th [[asset]] is determined from its [[Beta]]
$$E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i \left(E(R_m) - R_f\right)$$
- $E(R_i)$ = Expected [[Return|return]] of the $i$-th [[asset]]
- $R_f$ = Risk-free rate of [[Return|return]]
- $\beta_i$ = [[Beta]] of the $i$-th [[asset]] ([[systematic risk]])
- $E(R_m)$ = Expected [[Return|return]] of the market

Expanding $\beta_i$:
$$E(R_i) = R_f + \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\text{Var}(R_m)} \left(E(R_m) - R_f\right)$$

> The market demands higher [[Return|returns]] from higher [[Beta|beta]] stock, that means higher [[Covariance|covariance]] with the market stock. And they're willing to take no [[Return|returns]] if the [[beta]] is low, because that means it's less contributing to [[risk]] in the [[portfolio]].
