**Covariance** measures the **directional relationship** between the [[Return|returns]] on **two [[Asset|assets]]**.
$$\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})$$
Covariance is one of the essential idea of [[CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)]] - 

[[Risk]] is determined by covariance. Especially if you hold a large number of [[Asset|assets]]. Idiosyncratic Risk just doesn't matter. It all averages out. 

The [[Systematic Risk|systematic risk]], the [[Beta]], is equal to the [[Covariance|covariance]] divided by the [[Variance|variance]] of the market returns.
$$\beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\text{Var}(R_m)}$$ 
> This is something that is not in the habit of thinking of most amateur investors. They look at their investments one at a time, and they don't, you always have to go back and say, what's the covariance? That's what really matters for what happen to your [[portfolio]].

> Because when you invest in a lot of companies that are all the same, you're asking for trouble, because the whole thing is going to either blow up or succeed. And you can't live like that. You have to be looking for low covariance.
