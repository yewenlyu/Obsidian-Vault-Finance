$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \left[1 + \left(\frac{x - x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]}$$
- In finance, the Cauchy distribution has been used to model the distribution of [[Return|returns on investment]].
- It can capture the **heavy tails** ([[Risk|risk]]) often observed in financial data better than the [[Gaussian Distribution]].
