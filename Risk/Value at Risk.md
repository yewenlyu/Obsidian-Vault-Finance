VaR (Value at [[Risk]]) quantifies the [[Risk]] of an investment or of a [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. It is usually quoted in units of $ for a given probability and time horizon.

Example:
_1% one-year VaR of $10 million_
means there is 1% chance that a [[Portfolio]] will lose $10 million in a year

VaR is often used in conjunction with other [[Risk]] measures and [[Stress Test]] techniques to provide a more comprehensive assessment of [[Risk]].
