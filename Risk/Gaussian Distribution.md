$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$
- $f(x)$ = Probability Density Function
- $\sigma$ = [[Variance|Standard Deviation]]
- $\mu$ = Mean

## Central Limit Theorem

- Averages of a large number of independent identically distributed shocks (whose [[Variance|variance]] is finite) are approximately normally distributed.
- Can fail if the underlying shocks are fat tailed
- Can fail if the underlying shocks lose their independence
