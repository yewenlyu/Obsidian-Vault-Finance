In finance, a portfolio refers to a collection of financial [[Asset|assets]] such as stocks, bonds, cash, mutual funds, and other investments held by an individual or an [[institution]]. The purpose of creating a portfolio is to diversify investments, spreading [[Risk|risk]] across different [[Asset|assets]] to potentially reduce the impact of any single investment's poor performance on the overall portfolio.
