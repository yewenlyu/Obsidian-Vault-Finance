The **binomial distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of **successes** (such as pass/fail, heads/tails, etc.) in a fixed number of **independent trials**.

$$P_x = \binom{n}{x} \cdot p^x \cdot (1 - p)^{n - x}$$
- $P$ = binomial probability
- $x$ = number of times for a specific outcome within $n$ trials
- $\binom{n}{x}$ = number of combinations
- $p$ = probability of success on a single trial
- $n$ = number of trials
