If $n$ policies, each has independent probability $p$ of a claim, then the number of claims follows the the [[Binomial Distribution|binomial distribution]]. The [[Variance|standard deviation]] of the fraction of policies that result in a claim is
$$\text{SD} = \sqrt{\frac{p\cdot(1-p)}{n}}$$as $n$ gets large, [[Variance|standard deviation]] approaches 0, refer to the [[Law of Large Numbers]]
